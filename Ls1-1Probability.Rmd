# Probability
* *Probability*: given a random experiment (say rolong a die), a *probability* measure is  a population quantity that summarizes the randomness.

* probability that nothing *(impossible)* occurs = *0*, that something *(certain)* occurs is *1*.

* probability of something = 1 - probability of the *opposite* occurring.

* if A implies occurrence of B, then 
    $P(A) < P(B)$

* probability of the *union* of any two sets of outcomes that have *nothing in common* (mutually exclusive) is the sum of respective probabilities

    $P(A \cup B) = P(A)+ P(B)$
    
* For any two events, probability of *at least one occurs* = the sum of their probabilities - their intersection

    $P(A \cup B) = P(A)+ P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

# Density & Mass function: bell curve

## Random variable

A *random variable* is a numeric outcome of an experiment.
*discrete* / *continuous*
 
### Probability Mass Function (PMF)
* evaluates the probability that the discrete random variable takes on a specific value
